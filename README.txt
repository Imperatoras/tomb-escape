Tomb Escape : APCS 2020 Final Project
By Helena Williams, Diya Mohan, and Jubayer Ahmed

OUR PROJECT:
When you took the statue of Anubis off of its pedestal, the mummies and sphinxes in this tomb all came to life. Now you've got to escape before they kill you!

HOW TO RUN:
./run.sh in the terminal will make everything run! (make sure to chmod 777 to it first)

ENEMIES:
-Mummy: Patrols up and down in a set fashion. He will deal you one heart of damage if you end up in the 3x3 space around him!
Note that mummies are not immune to the Sphinx fire or colliding with one another. It is their fatal flaw!
-Sphinx: Sits in place and launches fireballs. They will deal you one heart of damage as well!

THINGS TO NOTE:
-A story prints in the terminal when you launch the game, make sure to read it!
-Controls: WASD to move
-If you die, the screen will be covered in skulls. If you win, the screen will be covered in Anubis statuette art.
-All of the pixel art IS in fact original :)
